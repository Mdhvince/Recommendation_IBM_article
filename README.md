# Recommendation engine for article on IBM Plateform

Created an end-to-end recommendation system for recommending articles related to IBM Watson Studio. Used collaborative filtering techniques, content based, and matrix factorization techniques to make recommendations that are relevant for each individual user.

## Method used
- Matrix Factorization: Funk Singular Value Decomposition
- Collaborative Filtering
- Content Based
- Ranked Based

## File Description
- rec_eng_ibm.ipynb: data cleaning and nlp + recommendations
- user-item-interactions.csv: interactions of users on articles
- articles_community: all articles + descriptions on ibm plateform
- recommender_finctions.py / recommender.py: My own Recommender module, see more <a href='https://github.com/Mdhvince/Recommendation_engine_module'> here </a>
- prep_data_display.py / production_ready.py : File with code ready for production
